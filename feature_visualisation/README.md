These files visualise the feature output of middle layers in U-net.\\
The main differences between the files are the structure of U-net used. See the UNet3d class.\\
These experiments evaluate how the change in hyperparameters is visually reflected in the features. The change we evaluate are (1) skip connection (2) The number of down sampling layers.
